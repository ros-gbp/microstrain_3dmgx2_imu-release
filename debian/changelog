ros-melodic-microstrain-3dmgx2-imu (1.5.3-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Added install rule for other files.
  * Added message if log4xx not found
  * Updated version to 1.5.2
  * Catkinized microstrain driver.
  * Updated initTime() to be called before calibrate.
  * Fix for calibration error on some devices.
  * oneiric fix
  * Updated to republish calibration status if a new calibration fails.
  * Ran tf bullet types migration script.
  * applying patch provided by RobZ
  * adding support for the 3DM-GX3 protocol
  * Now opens IMU with NOCTTY to avoid getting signaled if the serial port dies. Moved O_NONBLOCK to the correct position in the open call, could have caused problems when accessed by multiple programs otherwise (one of which wasn't locking).
  * Fixed spacing in quiet mode for IMU get_id utility. #4287 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/4287>
  * Quiet mode for get_id utility. #4287 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/4287>
  * Spelling for IMU get ID function. #4287 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/4287>
  * IMU utility to get device ID. #4287 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/4287>
  * Added Ubuntu platform tags to manifest
  * Fixed linker export in manifest.
  * add option to assume calibrated status on startup, to allow no-calibration
  * make calibration routine check for drift after it finished
  * remove deprecated subscriptions
  * Changed frameid frame_id. Orientation is now from the world frame to the imu frame. A 180 degree rotation around the y axis has been added so that the world frame z vector points up.
  * Tweaked error messages.
  * Marking imu_drivers as doc reviewed.
  * Added 'this is unstable' notices to the doxygen.
  * Took out call to diagnostics update when we are in error. The error broadcasts will take care of publishing the diagnostics in that case.
  * Made a few error messages more useful if you are not connected to an IMU or if there is a communication glitch.
  * Reworked error reporting. Added locking of the port. Made IO non-blocking to avoid race conditions between multiple reading processes. Closes tickets #1442 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/1442> #3188 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/3188> #2342 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/2342> #3356 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/3356> #3508 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/3508> #3507 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/3507>.
  * Switched imu_node.cc back to BSD only as it is less restrictive than LGPL.
  * Updated all licences to LGPL.
  * Updated stack documentation and license.
  * Tweaked doxygen main page.
  * Moved doxygen stub out of imu_node.cc
  * Renamed imu_data to imu, and pushed the main data topic into imu/data.
  * Corrected node name in microstrain_3dmgx2.launch
  * Fixed up doxygen.
  * Added -Wl,-rpath,-L/lib to cpp exports as requested by #3479 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/issues/3479>.
  * staging imu_drivers into tick-tock
  * Fixed the calibrate service call.
  * Marked as API cleared.
  * Got imu_node up to date with api changes in diagnostic_updater and self_test. Now sets HardwareID in diagnostics. Extended the ID that is returned by the self-test. Got rid of the thread that was previously needed just for self_test synchronization.
  * should not be blacklisted
  * Finished merging 3dmgx2 and imu_node. Time to deprecate the old packages.
  * Moved is_calibrated and calibrate into imu_data name space instead of ~ name space.
  * Merged imu_node and 3dmgx2 into microstrain_3dmgx2_imu. Still need to fix the package references in the files.
  * Created the microstrain_3dmgx2_imu package to subsume the imu_node and 3dmgx2_driver packages.
